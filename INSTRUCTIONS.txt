Welcome to what is essentially Crossy Road in first person 3D. Once you press Play in the editor, the game will begin.
Walk across the streets, collecting ducks while avoiding getting hit by cars. If you get hit by a car, the game ends.

You win the game by collecting all 10 rubber ducks found across the map. Good luck!

NOTE: In the Game window (that comes up when you press Play), change the resolution at the top of the window from "Free Aspect" to "Full HD".
Otherwise you may notice visual issues, as this game was designed for 16:9 aspect ratios.

NOTE 2: If you start walking at a very very slow pace (you can tell, it feels like a crawl and it's hard to make it across even slower roads)
then restart Unity. This seems to be some inconsistent Unity bug or something that I can't figure out the cause of.

Controls:
WASD - Move around (forward, left, right, backwards respectively)
Mouse - Look around
Collide/walk into duck - Pick up duck
